# Vegas-add-Picture-In-Picture
This script can be used in Vegas Pro if you have the VEGAS Picture In Picture effect.
The script automatically adjust the Pan/Crop of the selected video events to match the project's aspect ration and cover the 
whole picture/video. Then adds the Picture In Picture effect. It can save you a few clicks if you map it to a shortcut :)
